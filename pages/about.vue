          I am passionate about working at the intersection of product,
          engineering, and developer experience. I get excited by TailwindCSS,
          Vue, serverless technologies, Open Source, frontend simplicity, and
          minimalism. I love automating processes, building user-centric
          products, and enjoying a good cappuccino during a productive workday.
