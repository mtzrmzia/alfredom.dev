        I am passionate about working at the intersection of product,
        engineering, and developer experience. I get excited by TailwindCSS,
        Vue, serverless technologies, Open Source, frontend simplicity, and
        minimalism. I love automating processes, building user-centric products,
        and enjoying a good cappuccino during a productive workday.
